  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">ðŸŽ¯ My Hobbies</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    When Iâ€™m not deep in code or crafting ideas, Iâ€™m usually exploring the world through a creative lens. 
    My hobbies are more than just ways to unwindâ€”they shape how I think, solve problems, and stay inspired.

    <p>
      I treat technology like a creative playground. I love trying out new tools, testing fresh frameworks, 
      and building side projects just for fun. Whether itâ€™s automating small tasks or learning a new coding trick, 
      I enjoy turning curiosity into something real.

    <p>
      UI/UX design is a world where art meets functionâ€”and Iâ€™m fascinated by it. I often sketch interface ideas, 
      explore color theory, and analyze user behavior. Great design isnâ€™t just about how things look, 
      but how effortlessly they work.

    <p>
      Books are my constant companions. I enjoy reading across genresâ€”personal development, psychology, 
      fiction, and techâ€”because each one offers a new lens to see the world.

    <p>
      Iâ€™m a big fan of games that make you think. Strategy games and puzzles keep my mind sharp, 
      helping me approach challenges with patience and creativity.

    <p>
      I value health and mindfulness, often taking walks, exploring new (lactose-free!) recipes, 
      or simply stepping back to breathe and reflect. A clear mind makes room for better ideas and better code.
